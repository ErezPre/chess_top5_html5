            The International Chess Federation (FIDE) governs international
            chess competition. Each month, FIDE publishes the lists "Top 100
            Players", "Top 100 Women", "Top 100 Juniors" and "Top 100 Girls"
            rankings of countries according to the average rating of their top
            10 players and top 10 female players. The Elo rating system is used.
            <br />
            <br />
            Chess games are divided by FIDE into categories based on the time
            controls and/or number of moves per player.
            <br />
            Classical games' time control is usually more than an hour per
            player, rapid - 10-60 min per player, blitz - 1-10 min per player
            and bullet - less than 1 min per player (there are more categories
            out there but these are the most popular).
